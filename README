README file
===========

This repository contains code developed by the Chang lab at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

The code is experimental and not thoroughly tested.  Very frequently,
there are changes to one part of the code that breaks other parts.
There are certainly going to be bugs and incompatibilities.  However,
we do try to code defensively so that problems lead to tracebacks and
errors, rather than incorrect results.  If you get an error, or
something doesn't seem to be working, PLEASE LET US KNOW.

Most of the code here is written in Python, although there are some C
code and R scripts as well.

INSTALL
=======

1.  To build and install this package, type:

        python setup.py build
        # If there are no errors:
        sudo python setup.py install

    This setup script will install the following python packages (in
    the default location for your setup,
    e.g. /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/):

        genomicode/
          bin/
        arrayio/
        Betsy/


2.  The genomicode/bin/ path (described in step 1) contains executable
    scripts, including those that run the BETSY system, such as:

        betsy_run.py
        betsy_manage_cache.py
        pybinreg.py

    Either symlink these files into a path that your shell will search
    for executable files, e.g:
        ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/genomicode/bin/betsy_run.py \
          /usr/local/bin/

    Or, add this to your search path, e.g.:
        export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/genomicode/bin/"


3.  The setup script will also install two files in the user's home
    directory that will need to be configured:

        ${HOME}/.betsyrc
        ${HOME}/.genomicoderc

    Open these files in your favorite text editor and follow the
    instructions in the files to configure the system.  The setup.py
    installation script will try to configure this file automatically
    as much as possible.  If it cannot find a program, it will leave
    the option commented out.  If you install the program later,
    please uncomment the line and configure it according to the
    location of the program.

    This file will direct you to more external dependencies to
    install.  You can decide whether to install them depending on your
    needs (see SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS below).



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Because the packages here call many other tools, there are many
external dependencies, listed below.  It is likely that not all of
them will need to be installed for your use.  I recommend reviewing
these dependencies and installing just the ones that you may use.  You
can install additional ones later if you run into problems during your
analysis (e.g. you get an error message saying that something is
missing).

* Brad Chapman (https://github.com/chapmanb) contributed a script
  (conda_install.sh) that will install these dependencies using the
  Miniconda system (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/).  You can try using
  this to simplify the installation process.
