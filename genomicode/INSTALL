arrayplot.py requires PIL


Requirements:
- rpy2         R code in jmath.
- numpy        jmath.



jmath.start_R can generate an error when trying to load rJava:
>>> R = jmath.start_R()
>>> R("library(rJava)")
libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To get around this, find the libjvm.so library and symlink it to
somewhere on the library search path, e.g. /usr/lib64/.
ln -s \
 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0.x86_64/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so\
 /usr/lib64/

I wish I knew of a better way to do this.
