REQUIREMENTS

Because this interfaces with a lot of other tools, there are
unfortunately, a lot of required libraries.  

Some of the libraries are required for core functionality of BETSY and
the software.



I would recommend definitely installing all the REQUIRED parts of the
code.  For the OPTIONAL requirements, please see the description of
what it is used for, and then install if you intend to use the code
for that purpose.  Or, you can try skipping the installation for now.
If you run into problems during the analysis (e.g. you get a traceback
when running), then install at that time.

I just list the requirements here.  Please see each library for
instructions on how to install them.


If there's something else here, please let us know.
